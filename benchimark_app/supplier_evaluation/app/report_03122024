## Introduction


In the dynamic landscape of supply chain management, systematic supplier evaluation is crucial for maintaining competitive advantage and operational excellence. This comprehensive report analyzes {{< meta params.company >}}'s performance across five critical dimensions: quality, cost, delivery, service, and technology. Utilizing a standardized scoring methodology, each dimension is meticulously assessed on a scale of 1 to 10, culminating in a total potential score of 50 points. By providing a holistic and quantitative assessment, this evaluation offers actionable insights into the supplier's strengths, potential areas of improvement, and overall strategic alignment with our organizational objectives.

## Location
```{r}
plot_ly(
  data = params$data,
  type = "scattermapbox",
  lon = ~params$data$lon,
  lat = ~params$data$lat,
  text = ~ paste("Company:", params$data$Company, "<br>City:", params$data$City),
  mode = "markers",
  marker = list(size = 10)
) %>%
  layout(
    mapbox = list(
      style = "open-street-map",
      zoom = 4.5, # Adjust zoom for better visibility
      center = list(lon = mean(params$data$lon), lat = mean(params$data$lat))
    ),
    margin = list(l = 0, r = 0, t = 0, b = 0) # Remove all margins
  )

plot
```


## Analysis

### Rader Chart

```{r}
#|llabel: rader
#|message: false
#|tbl-cap: "Performance Chart by 5 factors"
#|ttbl-cap-location: bottom
plot <- plot_ly(
  type = "scatterpolar",
  fill = "toself"
) %>%
  add_trace(
    r = c(
      params$data$Cost, params$data$Quality, params$data$Delivery,
      params$data$Service, params$data$Technology, params$data$Cost
    ),
    theta = c("Cost", "Quality", "Delivery", "Service", "Technology", "Cost"),
    name = params$data$Company
  ) %>%
  layout(
    polar = list(
      radialaxis = list(visible = TRUE, range = c(0, 10))
    ),
    showlegend = FALSE,
    margin = list(l = 50, r = 50, t = 50, b = 50), # Adjust margins for centering
    autosize = TRUE # Ensure chart resizes dynamically
  )

plot
```



###  Bubble Chart (Cost vs Quality, size by Total Score)
```{r}
bubble_plot <- params$data %>% 
  ggplot( aes(
  x = Cost, y = Quality,
  size = total_score,
  color = Company
)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(3, 10)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Supplier Performance: Cost vs Quality",
    x = "Cost Score",
    y = "Quality Score",
    size = "Total Score"
  )
bubble_plot
```



## 4. Parallel Coordinates Plot
```{r}
parallel_plot <- params$data %>%
  select(Cost, Quality, Delivery, Service, Technology) %>%
  ggparcoord(
    alphaLines = 0.3,
    title = "Parallel Coordinates: Supplier Performance Dimensions"
  )
parallel_plot
```
